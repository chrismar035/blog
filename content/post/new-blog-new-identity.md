You may have noticed a few changes around here. First, a new domain name:
codegoalie.com. I am moving away from ChrisMar035 in favor os something, as I
said on Twitter, that "better show my love of programming and blocking
vulcanized rubber disks with my body." Also, my last name is not Mar.

Along with Twitter, I'll be moving other usernames to codegoalie shortly. I
already snagged codegoalie@gmail.com. Either way, if you see codegoalie or
chrismar035 anywhere, it's probably me.
