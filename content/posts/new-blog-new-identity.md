You may have noticed a few changes around here. First, a new domain name:
codegoalie.com. I am moving away from ChrisMar035 in favor os something, as I
said on Twitter, that "better show my love of programming and blocking
vulcanized rubber disks with my body." Also, my last name is not Mar.

Along with Twitter, I'll be moving other usernames to codegoalie shortly. I
already snagged codegoalie@gmail.com. Either way, if you see codegoalie or
chrismar035 anywhere, it's probably me.

__Update 2016-07027:__ I updated my Github username to
[@codegoalie](https://github.com/codegoalie). If you've cloned some public
repos or were following me, change those links. I've also re-registered
@chrismar035 again and will be updating repos with links to the new
corresponding ones.
